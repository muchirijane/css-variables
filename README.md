# css-variables
This small project helped me learn how to use JavaScript to change CSS variables.
<br>
The eventListener should be able to detect any changes with a click or mouse hover. 
<br>
Then a function is called to change the values of the spacing, blur and color.
<br>
<br>
The below i changed the the spacing and reducing the blur
